Calculating utilization distributions for animals, e.g. with Kernel Density or [Dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Model](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.01955.x/abstract), result in rasters with probabilities of presence. To calculate areas with equal levels of presence (contours) it is necessary to transform the raster, which is now done by the `getVolumeUD()`Â function from the [move package](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1349).

The function works with objects of the Raster class. This is an advantage over a similar function from the [`adehabitatHR` package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/adehabitatHR/index.html) (getvolumeUD), which works with objects of the class estUD and estUDm, that are created for example by the kernelUD function from the same package. Allowing objects from the Raster class ([`raster` package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html)) makes the getVolumeUD more flexible.

Using:

```R
new <- getVolumeUD(raster)
contour95 <- new<=0.
```

where new is the raster that is returned from `getVolumeUD()`, you calculate a new raster that has only 0 for cells that are outside the 95% contour and 1 for cells that are inside the 95% contour. It represents the 95% contour of the UD.

*Two rasters with UD from the same record. Left: raw output from a DBBMM calculation (probabilities are between 0 and 0.03). Right: transformed raster (cells have now the values of the contour they belong to; values are between 0 and 1).*

[A great thank you to [Bart Kranstauber](http://computational-ecology.com/main-lab/main-bart.html) that provided the majority of the functions code.]
