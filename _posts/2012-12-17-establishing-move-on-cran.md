On friday, December 14th, we successfully [published our software package ‘move’ at CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/move/index.html), the popular R repository. This was a huge step for me and my group. We were working on the package, that allows to import, analyze and visualize animal movement data, almost a year. We already published stable versions on [r-forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1349) prior to the publication on CRAN.

Thanks to colleagues and users from around the world we received useful feedback to make the package even better. We fixed problems and added further functionality. We now decided that it is time to make the package available to a broader audience. We published at CRAN since it is the primary repository for R packages.

Now, it is possible to download and install the ‘move’ package from within R with:

```R
install.packages("move")
```

We aim to add further functionalities to the package in the near future. We hope that the package will be useful for biologists in general and movement ecologists in specific.
