On Friday, December 14th, we successfully [published our software package ‘move’ at CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/move/index.html), the popular R repository. This was a huge step for me and my group. We were working on this package, which allows us to import, analyze and visualize animal movement data, for almost a year. We already published stable versions on [r-forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1349) before the publication on CRAN.

Thanks to colleagues and users from around the world we received useful feedback to make the package even better. We fixed problems and added further functionality. We now decided that it is time to make the package available to a broader audience. We published at CRAN since it is the primary repository for R packages.

Now, it is possible to download and install the ‘move’ package from within R with:

```R
install.packages("move")
```

We aim to add further functionalities to the package soon. We hope that the package will be useful for biologists in general and movement ecologists in specific.
