With the new version of the move package (0.5.4) that we uploaded on Friday many import issues were fixed. We tested the download function with all publicly available Movebank data sets. As long as the study has no double timestamps per individual ID the studies could be imported. Now, it makes it much more fun to interact with the WebImport interface. Just import specific animals from a study to calculate their utilization distribution, UD, or other movement-related parameters.

You find more about the move package on [our lab page](http://computational-ecology.com/main-move.html), or direct on [r-forge](http://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1349).

Visit as well the [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/) site to see which studies are public available.
