Within populations, some individuals use social learning more frequently than others, but why social learning phenotypes differ among individuals is poorly understood. We modelled the evolution of social learning frequency in a system where foragers compete for resources, and there are many different foraging options to learn about. Social learning phenotypes diverged when some options offered much better rewards than others and expected rewards changed moderately quickly over time. When options offered similar rewards or when rewards changed slowly, a single social learning phenotype evolved. This held for fixed and simple conditional social learning rules. Sufficiently complex conditional social learning rules prevented the divergence of social learning phenotypes under all conditions. Our results explain how competition can promote the divergence of social learning phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary scientists argue that cooperation is central to human ecological success. Theoretical models, and behavioral experiments have found that human cooperation is conditional and context dependent, that individuals vary in their propensity to cooperate, and that cooperation can be stabilized by reciprocity within a group. However, outside of behavioral experiments, these findings have been difficult to validate with observations of cooperation in natural settings, especially in industrial societies, cash economies and structured organizational contexts. Here, we report in situ observations of behavioral cooperation and reciprocity from organizations embedded in a cash economy. We study small consumer food cooperatives or `food clubs', in which members share bulk food purchases, and are considered to be heavily dependent on cooperation. We take advantage of a high-resolution purchasing dataset of all economic interactions for 1,528 individuals across 35 clubs, including 10,261 bulk purchases over a combined total of 107 years of club purchasing data. We develop a network method to detect economic reciprocity, categorize economic behavior as directly reciprocal, indirectly reciprocal, or non-reciprocal, and statistically classify individual behavioral types (reciprocator, helper, and beneficiary). Observed patterns of reciprocity confirm the central findings of theoretical and experimental studies. Reciprocity is highly abundant in most clubs, with direct reciprocity far more common (72\%) than indirect reciprocity (11\%). Reciprocators are the most common (69\%) and the most stable behavioral type, but clubs vary significantly. Our results provide some of the first observational evidence of economic reciprocity and cooperation generally. They imply that cooperation may be a more important force in industrial societies, organizational contexts, and cash economies than currently understood. These results solidify the findings of the behavioral study of cooperation and open the door for greater study and application of cooperation in organizational management and economic policy.},

Previous theoretical models of public goods games have generally focused on the amounts individuals contribute to the public good. Yet a much less-studied strategic aspect of public goods games, the timing of contributions, can also have dramatic consequences for individual and collective performance. Here, we develop two stage game theoretical models to explore how the timing of contributions evolves. In the first stage, individuals contribute to a threshold public good based on a performance schedule. The second stage begins once the threshold is met, and the individuals then compete as a function of their performance. We show how contributing rapidly is not necessarily optimal, because delayers can act as `cheats,' avoiding contributing while reaping the benefits of the public good. However, delaying too long can put the delayers at a disadvantage as they may be ill-equipped to compete. These effects lead to bistability in a single group, and spatial diversity among multiple interacting groups.},

  abstract = {Many white-faced capuchin monkey dyads in Lomas Barbudal, Costa Rica, practise idiosyncratic interaction sequences that are not part of the species-typical behavioural repertoire. These interactions often include uncomfortable or risky elements. These interactions exhibit the following characteristics commonly featured in definitions of rituals in humans: (i) they involve an unusual intensity of focus on the partner, (ii) the behaviours have no immediate utilitarian purpose, (iii) they sometimes involve `sacred objects', (iv) the distribution of these behaviours suggests that they are invented and spread via social learning, and (v) many behaviours in these rituals are repurposed from other behavioural domains (e.g. extractive foraging). However, in contrast with some definitions of ritual, capuchin rituals are not overly rigid in their form, nor do the sequences have specific opening and closing actions. In our 9260 h of observation, ritual performance rate was uncorrelated with amount of time dyads spent in proximity but (modestly) associated with higher relationship quality and rate of coalition formation across dyads. Our results suggest that capuchin rituals serve a bond-testing rather than a bond-strengthening function. Ritual interactions are exclusively dyadic, and between-dyad consistency in form is low, casting doubt on the alternative hypothesis that they enhance group-wide solidarity.

Consequently, invention has been relatively understudied outside the human lineage\textemdash despite being the source of new traditions. This neglect leaves basic questions unanswered: what factors promote the creation of new ideas and practices? What affects their spread or loss? We critically review the existing literature, focusing on four levels of investigation: traits (what sorts of behaviours are easiest to invent?), individuals (what factors make some individuals more likely to be inventors?), ecological contexts (what aspects of the environment make invention or transmission more likely?), and populations (what features of relationships and societies promote the rise and spread of new inventions?). We aim to inspire new research by highlighting theoretical and empirical gaps in the study of innovation, focusing primarily on inventions in non-humans. Understanding the role of invention and innovation in the history of life requires a well-developed theoretical framework (which embraces cognitive processes) and a taxonomically broad, cross-species dataset that explicitly investigates inventions and their transmission.

Using a fluorescent dye, even single labeled neurons can be visualized and resolved up to an imaging depth of 150??m through the cleared cuticle. Hydrogen-peroxide, which was used to clear the cuticle, does not preclude immunocytochemical techniques, shown by successful labeling of serotonin-immunoreactive neurons (5HT-ir) in the ants' brain. The 'transparent insect protocol' presented here is especially suited for small arthropods where dissection of organs is very demanding and difficult to achieve. Furthermore, the insect organs are preserved in situ thus allowing a more precise three-dimensional reconstruction of the structures of interest compared to, e.g., dissected or sectioned tissue. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using information filtered by others is quicker, more efficient and less risky than randomly sampling the environment. To explain the mix of social and individual learning used by animals in nature, most models penalize the quality of socially derived information as either out of date, of poor fidelity or costly to acquire. Competition for limited resources, a fundamental evolutionary force, provides a compelling, yet hitherto overlooked, explanation for the evolution of mixed-learning strategies. We present a novel model of social learning that incorporates competition and demonstrates that (i) social learning is favoured when competition is weak, but (ii) if competition is strong social learning is favoured only when resource quality is highly variable and there is low environmental turnover. The frequency of social learning in our model always evolves until it reduces the mean foraging success of the population. The results of our model are consistent with empirical studies showing that individuals rely less on social information where resources vary little in quality and where there is high within-patch competition. Our model provides a framework for understanding the evolution of social learning, a prerequisite for human cumulative culture.},

We find unexpected eco-evolutionary feedbacks from culture onto social networks and vice versa. We show that selecting for skill generalists results in sparse networks with diverse skill sets, whereas selecting for skill specialists results in dense networks and a population that specializes on the same few skills on which everyone is an expert.

  abstract = {Humans have adapted to an immense array of ecologies by accumulating culturally transmitted knowledge and skills. Culture accumulates in at least two ways: via more distinct cultural traits, or via improvements of existing cultural trait. A trade-off is expected between these owing to the fact that social learning opportunities are finite and social learning often requires multiple exposures. Furthermore, what kind of culture accumulates depends on, and coevolves with, the social structure of societies. Here we show that the coevolution of social networks for learning and cumulative culture results in two distinct pathways to cultural adaptation: highly connected populations with high proficiency but low cultural trait diversity vs. sparsely connected populations with low proficiency but more cultural trait diversity. Importantly, we show there is a general conflict between group-level payoffs, which is maximised in highly connected groups that attain high proficiency, and individual level selection, which favours disconnection. This conflict emerges from the interaction of social learning with population structure and causes populations to cycle between the two cultural and network states. The same conflict creates a paradox where improving individual innovation rates lowers the payoffs of groups. Finally, we explore how populations navigate these two pathways in heterogeneous and changing environments, and show that high heterogeneity in payoffs and slow rate of environmental change favours high proficiency, while fast rate of environmental change favours more trait diversity. We also find that the proficiency pathway to cultural adaptation is favoured with increased population size, but only in slow changing environments. Our results uncover previously unrecognised trade-offs and tensions in the coevolutionary dynamics of cumulative culture and social structure, with broad implications for human social evolution.},

The causes of those differences, however, remain largely unclear. Using an agent-based model, we tested the hypothesis that as a result of reproductive skew differences in energetic requirements for reproduction affect the value of social information. We found that social learning is associated with lower variance in yield and is more likely to evolve in risk- averse low-skew populations than in high-skew populations. Reproductive skew may also result in sex differences in social information use, as empirical data suggest that females are often more risk-averse than males. To explore how risk may affect sex differences in learning strategies, we simulated learning in sexually reproducing populations where one sex experiences more reproductive skew than the other. When both sexes compete for the same resources, they tend to adopt extreme strategies: the sex with greater reproductive skew approaches pure individual learning and the other approaches pure social learning. These results provide insight into the conditions that promote individual and species level variation in social learning and so may affect cultural evolution.},
