I am computational and evolutionary biologist with a background in behavioural physiology and ecology. My research focusses on **how we make culture and how this affects us**. 

I am **developing simulation models** and **analyse existing data** to study how culture emerges from individual and inter-individual actions and how it spreads in populations. 

I explicitly model dynamic social networks to simulate real-world interaction and information sharing patterns that change over time. I am currently working towards a modelling framework that is more explicit about the process of learning, taking into account insights from developmental psychology, ethnography, and anthropology.

I am a member of the **Theory in Cultural Evolution Lab** ([TICE](https://ticelab.mystrikingly.com)) in the **Deaprtment of Human Behavior, Ecology and Culture ([HBEC](https://www.eva.mpg.de/ecology/index/))** at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig.
